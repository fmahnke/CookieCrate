0.2.0
=====
* Blow away the notification priorities code, which managed notification times
better but caused missing notifications when some were enabled/disabled.
* Add the menu under all other Cookie Clicker menus.

0.1.0
=====
* Add notification for 'research complete'.
* For golden/wrath cookie and deer notifications, add time estimate for the next
popup. For example, when a wrath cookie appears, its notification also shows the
estimated time until the next deer will appear.

0.0.0
=====
* First stable version.
* Notifications for golden/wrath cookie spawn, golden/wrath cookie about to
despawn, reindeer spawn, and cookie/reindeer simultaneous spawn (el-deer
frenzy possible!)
